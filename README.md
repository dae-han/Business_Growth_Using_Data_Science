# Predictive Customer Analytics for Optimizing Business Growth (Customer Segmentation and Consumer Behavior Prediction)


## Problem Statement

In this project, I provided data-based insights into the consumer behaviors and made predictions on their future moves in order to help an online retailer optimize their business growth.

I first defined some Key Performance Metrics (KPIs) that represent the company's business goal and segmented the customers based on the KPIs. I then predicted the behaviors of each customer groups.

## Executive Summary

### `01_Metrics.ipynb`
This notebook was intended help the business track and analyze their growth. In order to do so, I defined some metrics that best capture the company's core value that their product delivers to the customers.

According to Sean Ellis, CEO of Growth Hackers, the single metric that best captures the core value value is called **The North Star Metric**. For this online retailer, the north start metric was their Monthly Revenue. I also defined some other KPIs that would help the retailer track their growth--such as monthly active customers, monthly order count, average revenue per order.
